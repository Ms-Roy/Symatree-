The main purpose for this project is to develop a mobile application for tutoring services within the University of Ottawa. Students enrolled in an university often finds difficulty in many courses and are often discouraged to seek help due to limited resources available within the university. Mainly, every student has at least once experienced their professor and/or teaching assistant to lack quality in teaching. Low quality teaching results poor gain in knowledge and thus outcomes many students to either fail or do poorly in a course regardless of the ease of the material. Therefore, it raises our attention to find a solution and hence make an application that allows students to get access to tutors that have excelled in the particular course(s) they are currently struggling with.

Symatree, will allow students to either take advantage of courses they have excelled in and earn money electronically by becoming a tutor, or pay tutors by learning and getting help from them regarding course materials. This mobile application hence varies for the two types of users: tutors and students. In addition, Symatree allows the opportunity for a user to be both tutor and student.  

Symatree however makes a restriction for becoming a tutor for security reasons and therefore is controlled by the system administrator. The system admin must assess and access the required documents such as transcripts and police records, and decide whether an individual is qualified to be a tutor. Upon meeting the minimum requirements, an individual can be registered to tutor a particular course. On the other hand, upon creating an account, a user entitled as a student, can navigate and browse through the application at free cost and check for available tutors for a specific course. If available, students can then either sign-up for one to one session online or in-person meeting or group sessions that could be either on-line or in-person. In addition, payment and money is transferred only after when a meeting has been done successfully between a tutor and a student.

There already exists a variety of tutorial applications but however courses vary from universities based on the context. Therefore, it is the only application existing where the context is controlled since both the student and the tutor have learned the same materials or even had the same professor. Also, most application does not provide the opportunity for students to be able to request a tutor right away at the place of their desired location (e.g their house) and with this application, it is very much possible to do just as how Uber eats work. This application will therefore be the most efficient tutoring application existing since it connects both the student and the tutor effectively, making learning more enjoyable and resulting excellent grades.

The main purpose for this project is to develop a mobile application for tutoring services within the University of Ottawa.
Students enrolled in an university often finds difficulty in many courses and are often discouraged to seek help due to limited resources available 
within the university.This application will be advantageous to students who wants to make cash by being a tutor in a course they
have excelled in and to those students who have difficulty in the course materials and are seeking tutors at a flexible price and
suitable time. Symatree provides one-to-one session, group-session and instant help. Prices therefore differs based on the services
to be provided. One-to-One session allows students and tutors to find a suitable time for tutoring session only between the student 
and the tutor at any places within the campus. Group session on the other hand will provide a tutoring session between many students
and only one tutor at a suitable time at any places within the campus. Instant help however is where the student requests help now at 
a desired location (such as their residence) and the tutor will drive/travel at the destination within two hour period. Instant help
therfore will be the most expensive deal for the student, with one-to-one session being the next priciest deal and the cheapest will
therefore be the group-session. Payment is therefore mandatory and will be done via credit card and the payment should be deposit to 
the client bank account directly.

Symatree is unique because we understand the importance of course context and how it can differ largely between university to 
university and thus it forces tutors to be within the university. Having tutors within the university because students seeks 
for students who have knowledge for that specific course being taught in the past, preferbly had the same professor so they 
can seek tips on how to master the course. Symatree therefore will first focus in University of ottawa and soon will grow 
in Canada and next will provide services internationally.
