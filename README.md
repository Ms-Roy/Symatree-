The main purpose for this project is to develop a mobile application for tutoring services within the University of Ottawa.
Students enrolled in an university often finds difficulty in many courses and are often discouraged to seek help due to limited resources available 
within the university.This application will be advantageous to students who wants to make cash by being a tutor in a course they
have excelled in and to those students who have difficulty in the course materials and are seeking tutors at a flexible price and
suitable time. Symatree provides one-to-one session, group-session and instant help. Prices therefore differs based on the services
to be provided. One-to-One session allows students and tutors to find a suitable time for tutoring session only between the student 
and the tutor at any places within the campus. Group session on the other hand will provide a tutoring session between many students
and only one tutor at a suitable time at any places within the campus. Instant help however is where the student requests help now at 
a desired location (such as their residence) and the tutor will drive/travel at the destination within two hour period. Instant help
therfore will be the most expensive deal for the student, with one-to-one session being the next priciest deal and the cheapest will
therefore be the group-session. Payment is therefore mandatory and will be done via credit card and the payment should be deposit to 
the client bank account directly.

Symatree is unique because we understand the importance of course context and how it can differ largely between university to 
university and thus it forces tutors to be within the university. Having tutors within the university because students seeks 
for students who have knowledge for that specific course being taught in the past, preferbly had the same professor so they 
can seek tips on how to master the course. Symatree therefore will first focus in University of ottawa and soon will grow 
in Canada and next will provide services internationally.
